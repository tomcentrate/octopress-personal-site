I'm Tommy Lee from Orlando, Florida. I'm a software engineer, problem solver, natural devil's advocate, unpaid life coach, foodie. I enjoy talking about the human / business / user side of software development and projects.

I consider and write about software from a consumer-oriented perspective. I treat most projects I have worked on as a business. Needs will change depending on the life-cycle and the type of product, and I do my best to balance out these trade-offs.

I love hearing about the projects that others are working on.
