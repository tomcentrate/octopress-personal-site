The Digital Wave is the next generation of everyone's favorite sporting event activity, 'The Wave'. This idea was conceived for [Hack the Arena](http://hackthearena.co/) 2016. It was built on Node.js and Socket.io.

### How it works
Users would put in their seat numbers and get assigned a section. They would then get a screen color that shifts and changes. Users would then point their cell phones to the jumbotron, and be part of a light show
