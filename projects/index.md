This is a list of projects that I've been involved with publicly and want to share. A lot of other projects are on my github. Feel free to check them out.

# Current Projects

Currently I have the following up and running.

## Friendship CRM

It's management, on friendship! Originally used so that I have a better way of keeping track of different relationships and people in my life, so I can be more responsive and better. Started out as a prototype made in [AirTable](https://airtable).

#### Current Goals


# Archived Projects

### Digital Wave
* [Github](https://github.com/mickmuzac/digitalwave)
* [DevPost Page](http://devpost.com/software/digital-wave)

The Digital Wave is the next generation of everyone's favorite sporting event activity, 'The Wave'. This idea was conceived for [Hack the Arena](http://hackthearena.co/) 2016. It was built on Node.js and Socket.io.

### How it works
Users would put in their seat numbers and get assigned a section. They would then get a screen color that shifts and changes. Users would then point their cell phones to the jumbotron, and be part of a light show
