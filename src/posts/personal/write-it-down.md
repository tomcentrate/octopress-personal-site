From my many mentors, I learned that their small, key habits came from a lesson hard learned. My personal ones that I've picked up so far.

- Do a silent 5 (mississippi) second countdown after hanging up from a conference call with the client.
- It's worth the little extra money to pay someone else, to save hours or weeks of time a month for yourself.
- Take photo's only during the golden hour before sunset, or while the sun in your eyes.
- Wait a few beats before responding.
- Write it down.

## Why Writing It down matters

The last lesson came from someone who had to switch contexts frequently, and has a lifetime of experience dealing with different areas simultaneously. He had many good ideas, some developed with friends over beer, in the back of a fishing boat. A fun idea over chats can get lost the next day, only to resurface, fully developed by another company years later.

## Gives your brain breathing room

I have a hard time focusing on work when major life events and concerns are on top of mind. Writing down the concerns and setting time in the future gives me a momentary peace, hopefully to handle it later.

Items such as "Look over weird credit card charge alerts", "See doctor about weird itching" or "Address personal issues and gripes about Best friend" seem serious in the moment. They may be serious, or appear much bigger due to the immediacy of the situation.

## Starting Point: Note Capture System
An empty Notepad may be all we need, but the goal is the same. I need a simple way in order to pop-in, pop-out any sort of thoughts or ideas. 

- Easy to Use
- Available almost everywhere
- Single Source of truth.

Google Keep and other Notes Apps are also useful. Mostly we want also the ability to search and possibly categorize different notes into different areas.

I personally use org-mode and emacs. I fell in love with the capture anywhere keybindings, journaling, tagging, and TODO organizations. Using command line tools and other search methods is comfortable for me as well.


### Habit: File and Forget for now

This took me a while to get used to. 

1. Write down "the thing that needs to be out of the mind." With enough details to rebuild the context. 

   - Bad: Look into Why am I upset with my manager
   - Better: Address perceived disrespect from my manager in morning meeting. Short, curt responses made me upset.
   
2. Schedule a Time in the future to look at the issue.
3. Close the Window.

### Habit: Document new findings

Whenever I learn something new, or a weird thing that I had difficulty finding, I write it down. This is usually business practices, or technology, or ideas. 

But I've also done it for off-the-cuff information that I easily forget. After a first date or meeting, I would do a mind-dump of details, topics and small things the other person has told me.



## Maintenance of The notes

Once a day, I go through the written notes for the day and groom
