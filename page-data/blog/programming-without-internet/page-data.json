Chaperoning and Chaffeuring around. With some downtime, and not in the physical fitness to jump around, it felt like a good time to pull out the laptop to work on some side projects.</p>\n<p>At a few of these places, they offer guest networks as a common courtesy. Unfortunately, some of the free WI-FI connections aren't that great, and I could not get a solid connection. What's a guy to do?</p>\n<p>In periods of network downtime, here are a few things I have done to feel slightly more productive.</p>\n<h2>Program by Guessing.</h2>\n<p>How many times have you tried this? Picking up a new programming language, or framework, we let the IDE and it's QuickStart be our guide. Whenever I come from a language that's similar, I do a little divination, programming by guessing at what the method names or standard library names are. Sometimes we can get lucky.This time was not one of those times.</p>\n<h2>Dissecting Examples</h2>\n<p>I'm pretty new to Android Development. For the short time I was without internet, I was thinking of doing something simple. I opened up a few template projects, and played with wiring up the different templates together. Android Studios' UI Builder was a definite good use of my time.</p>\n<p>I'm sure a lot of you have done this before. I opened up an Android Project through Android Studio, and started relying on AutoCompletes. I did rely on hitting Firebase for my application, and without access to the network, I started a little service of my own. I'm pretty comfortable with Rails, so I created a small API Service and routed the firebase urls to my localhost.</p>\n<h2>Write Tests</h2>\n<p>There's probably not enough test coverage when we're building our personal projects. Some form of test coverage would be great to do.</p>\n<h2>Future-Proof solution. Download it now!</h2>\n<p>While doing a little research, I came across <a href=\"http://devdocs.io/\">devdocs</a>.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Programming without Internet?","date":"01 February, 2016"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/programming-without-internet/"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
