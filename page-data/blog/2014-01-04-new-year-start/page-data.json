We have a lot of plans in store for this year. </p>\n<h3>New Blog</h3>\n<p>I haven't blogged in a long time, maybe since the days of xanga or myspace, but I found that it was appropriate to spread the same information around over and over again. Maybe they could be tutorials, math or physicsy related information, or cool projects i'm working on. Whatever works. While I'm used to a CMS platform like Wordpress or Drupal, some nice folks at <a href=\"http://reddit.com/r/webdev\">/r/webdev</a> recommended a static blog generator for a change of pace. currently checking out <a href=\"http://jekyllrb.com\">Jekyll</a>, which keeps me focused on the content first.</p>\n<h4>Projects</h4>\n<p>I graduated a month ago (yay), waiting for a fancy piece of paper to arrive. This year I hope to have the following projects wrapped up:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a site to monitor the ethics of big business, for better consumer awareness. a <a href=\"http://boycotthelper.com\">boycott helper</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://ptfgames.com\">Past to Future Games</a> front page, site and the Dark Empire RPG. An entire platform rebuild is always fun.</li>\n<li>Personal site for a little fun.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://geekyme.com.br\">GeekyMe</a> store, get this shipping thing done.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://cafebunny.com\">CafeBunny</a> of course.</li>\n<li>and Launch <a href=\"http://mummer.us\">Tera's personal site</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Skills</h3>\n<p>We're going to focus on a few fundamentals this year. To round out my experiences and hone it in, we're going to learn a few new things. Mostly some UX and Javascript. Big topics include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>SASS, LESS and CSS related things.</li>\n<li>Javascript, checking out React.js</li>\n<li>Focus on some mobile related development.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Server Related</h4>\n<p>While apache servers are standard, I've been looking into new server technologies. Specifically interested in the nginx and varnish cache servers. May write up some posts about setting those up. </p>\n<h4>Self Gratification</h4>\n<p>Thank you for stopping by and reading my first post. I hope future posts will be more beneficial.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"A New Start","date":"05 January, 2014"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2014-01-04-new-year-start/"}}}
