They are a great experience for developing a lot of interesting ideas in a short amount of times. It's extremely rewarding to get a product out the door over a weekend, or even a night.</p>\n<p>Some companies have made hackathons feel extremely exploitative. They'll stuff a bunch of developers in a room, with free pizza and some prizes and they get to keep the results of your work.</p>\n<p>The next time you see an interesting event to participate in, please consider these in mind.</p>\n<h2>Find a hackathon that put you first</h2>\n<p>Choose the ones that support your rights. We work hard for our projects, and they belong to us. A lot of issues arise due to some of these problems</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Talk with your Local meetups and user groups for recommendations</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Each of the ones I chose to participate had the following criteria:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The participant keeps all rights to the code they produce</li>\n<li>The event has been vetted out by credible people with a good track record of support.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Finding a credible event can be difficult. Talk with your Local meetups and user groups for recommendations. In Orlando, we have a few tech advocates that go out of their way to check on these. </p>\n<p>Once you find a decent hackathon that would benefit you, it's time to prepare yourself!</p>\n<h2>Have a goal in mind</h2>\n<p>Having achievable expectations allows us to feel successful at these events. </p>\n<p>Fellow hackathon team member <a href=\"%5Bhttp://mckmc.com/\">Mick Musak</a> recommended to set my expectations at the start the Hack the Arena event.</p>\n<p>I chose a goal of just completing an app, and learned a bit more about how Web Sockets worked in Node.js.</p>\n<p>I brought my friend <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/timothy-findling-b000b955\">Timothy Findling</a>, who is very strong at a data-oriented project. He had very limited experience with modern Javascript and web apps. His goal was to receive free swag.</p>\n<h3>Keeps your mind grounded</h3>\n<p>At the Hack the Arena event, there were multiple groups that had similar ideas. Our idea of a digital light scheme was done on a hardware level, and I felt eclipsed. I messed up on the presentation, and felt really embarrassed.</p>\n<p>Seeing that I was upset, Team members, Mick and Tim, told me their goals were fulfilled. They were proud to participate, and was happy to have the project on their githubs.</p>\n<p>By setting the expectation, they were satisfied.</p>\n<p>Here's a compilation list of my goals at the past hackathons</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Learn React</li>\n<li>Learn React Native</li>\n<li>Build a small fun game that I would play</li>\n<li>Create an Android App</li>\n<li>Don't freak out when presenting the idea</li>\n<li>Get a T-Shirt</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Use your B-tier ideas</h2>\n<p>If you have concerns about being exploited for your brilliance and hard work, I have a great idea, well, a mediocre idea.</p>\n<p>Save the best ideas for yourself, and use one of the throwaway ideas. </p>\n<p>You're a person who can come up with a bunch of ideas, and they're cheap to think up. It's the implementation that takes effort.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Leave enough for the imagination</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Some may disagree with this idea, and that's okay.</p>\n<h3>Use the Throwaway Jokes</h3>\n<p>I use my time at Hackathons to learn new things, or build a slightly interesting idea. This reduces the amount of personal risk to my ego when my awesome idea gets shot down due to poor execution.</p>\n<p>This is where I pull out a list of joke ideas. In fact, a few local winners of hackathons have won with an X for Y product clone. These ideas are great for learning new tech.</p>\n<h2>Build for your audience</h2>\n<p>It's really easy to try to do everything in a project for the hackathon. When we plan on a regular project, we try to get all the different features needed for the idea to work. On a time constraint, a lot of features are unnecessary.</p>\n<h3>Presentation Oriented Design</h3>\n<p>Many of the projects available relies on having the 3-5 minutes to present your project. Spend a fair amount of time designing what the screens would look like, and the basic flow of the idea.</p>\n<p>This allows us to skip certain 'crucial' elements of an application, like authentication, or server communications. </p>\n<h3>Time is the ultimate enemy</h3>\n<p>Plan on creating the smallest MVP you can imagine, then make it smaller. Depending on the time of the hackathon, a lot of items are unnecessary.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Reduce the scope just enough to get your point across </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>OAuth2 Social Media Authentication for an instagram clone, don't need it. </p>\n<p>An entire backend server to process data, you might not need it. </p>\n<p>On projects where I'm learning something completely fresh, or a lot of members with little experience, I want something super small and simple. </p>\n<p>You'll want to reduce the scope just enough to get your point across.</p>\n<h2>Keep your heart light</h2>\n<p>Tensions get high for competitors, trying to push out an idea as soon as possible. Remember to laugh, and believe that people are doing their best.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Tips for Having a great Hackathon Experience","date":"18 May, 2016"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/personal/hackathon-tips/"}}}
