How do we remain relevant in our understanding of web architecture? New frameworks rise and fall faster than a prime-time lineup. Wheels are reinvented faster than we can put them on cars!</p>\n<h2>My apprehension</h2>\n<p>When I'm doing things by myself or at my job, I want to get it done. I've developed habits to avoid using new / exciting / untested stuff for production. I also avoid rolling my own...anything. For the client, and for anyone else down the line, maintenance can be more expensive and mentally tasking. They want a working awesome product.</p>\n<p>Coming up with new projects, I don't imagine the minor (but important) details of my stack. I'm more interested in the end product. Architecting out a solution, drawing out my tables and relations, these are the parts I enjoy. My standard set of tools: Laravel / Rails, MySQL, Bootstrap, Nginx. Anything that gets it rolling out the door.</p>\n<p>Why should I learn Bash when I have Python? Who the hell needs to learn another new Javascript framework when they're just going to change in the next few months. Why should I get out of my comfortable, safe zone, and learn something new.</p>\n<p>For me, it was the fear of failing to understand. After programming for a while, there was a certain comfort in knowing that things worked the way you expected them to work. Switching may take me a lot longer to learn, and cause me problems in getting what I want.</p>\n<p>Life is hectic, and stressful. Programming is safe. It's my sandbox.</p>\n<h3>Improving creative morale</h3>\n<p>I had a strange week filled with visits to the cinema. I thought of a game regarding movie earnings and Adam Sandler. Given a Movie title and the budget, provided by BoxOfficeMojo, the player had to guess the gross earnings.</p>\n<p>Jackbox.tv's online game model of an online sign-in and streaming looked amazing. I love the idea of a client-server game sessions, and the ease of sign-in. The interface is pretty slick. I want something like that.</p>\n<p>This is a place where my usual programming tools were insufficient to my ideas. While I could use Rails' ActionCable, there was a lot of interface heavy things I wanted. I've been doing a lot of reading about some Real Time Javascript frameworks like Meteor.</p>\n<p>Some of my other friends would take this idea, and form a medium-sized team where a lot of people do very little. Maybe make a Kickstarter from it. This is a silly prototype, and something that I want. So I started building.</p>\n<p>It's still not done yet. But the passion of creation is back.</p>\n<h2>When building is not enough</h2>\n<p>Meeting other people who appear passionate about the craft reminds me of why I started in the first place. I came to this industry since the challenge exists. While programming can be a solitary activity, we have a community full of supportive, brash, intelligent developers that can help.</p>\n<h3>Help a newbie</h3>\n<p>Working in coffee shops for the past few months, I met a few 'up-and-coming' developers. I'm not too sure what that means, but these kinds of people are extremely hungry and passionate about new stuff.</p>\n<p>Encouraging their growth and development brings all the warm fuzzies into me. They show me their projects. I love seeing them. While I don't have any pretty things to show yet, I have my favorite tools. I love showing off Github Pages and setting up their machines for Jekyll. Demonstrating the power of Virtual Machines and how easy it is for them to get a development environment setup so they can try out a new language or node.js tool. Or even helping them debug a current problem.</p>\n<h3>Contributing to Open Source</h3>\n<p>There are a few tools that I like to use, but documentation can be kind of scarce until I learned how to use it. Reading through open source code for fun may not be the first thing I went to, but helping to fix a bug that I ran into time and again helped.</p>\n<h3>Join a meetup</h3>\n<p>In college, I remember meeting with people of like minds, going through a similar trials and tribulations of finishing school work. I'm not used to meeting with other people with the same job title I have. Meeting up and Talking with others of like minds helps.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Programming Learning Slumps","date":"24 August, 2015"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/personal/on-getting-excited-about-new-programming-stuff/"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
