The layout on Rental Cars Search results have been broken on Safari. We suspected that this had to do with Safari's sppecific handling of divs and invalid HTML.</p>\n<h2>The General Setup</h2>\n<p>So the affected code in question looks like this. We have a homebrew JS template that looks and acts roughly like this.</p>\n<pre><code>&#x3C;script type=\"text/template\" id=\"rental-car-details\">\r\n    &#x3C;div>\r\n       ...\r\n    &#x3C;/div>\r\n&#x3C;/script>\r\n\r\n... Somewhere in a JS file...\r\n\r\nvar details = $('#rental-car-details').clone();\r\n...\r\ndetails.replace(\"{{pricing}}\", priceDetails);\r\n...\r\nresultsBody.append(details);\n</code></pre>\n<p>We have a template, and we build a DOM element, that gets injected after results come back from an AJAX request.</p>\n<h2>Check the Commit Logs</h2>\n<p>We confirmed with QA that this was a new bug. Checking the logs, we see only one major commit from the last valid section.</p>\n<h1>Test By Bisection</h1>\n<p>I reduced a lot of the code down to make sure that no other divs were affecting it. To make sure that the layout was stable even before this chunk of template exists.</p>\n<p>Since this template is loaded via a template tag in Javascript. I started commenting out code and anything irrelevant, to find the part of the load that breaks the code.</p>\n<h2>The Cause</h2>\n<p>I started commenting out different parts of the template, and was able to identify the exact line of HTML that causes the problem.</p>\n<p>This was that line</p>\n<pre><code>{{strike}}\r\n&#x3C;span class=\"actual-price\">\r\n    &#x3C;span class=\"dollar\">$&#x3C;/span>{{period_price}}\r\n&#x3C;/span>\r\n&#x3C;span class=\"perday\">/{{period.abbr}}&#x3C;/span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>So we kept pairing it down. to eventually get to:</p>\n<pre><code>&#x3C;span class=\"dollar\">$&#x3C;/span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>Yes, so while this is okay in most of the browsers, for some reason, in Safari. When this is injected, this breaks the layout.</p>\n<h3>Test cases for solutions.</h3>\n<p>So we did some small tests, seeing if it had something to do with the characters, or the signs. And what we came up was this:</p>\n<pre><code>&#x3C;!-- This *somehow* fixes it -->\r\n&#x3C;span class=\"dollar\"> $ &#x3C;/span>\r\n\r\n&#x3C;!-- This is still broken -->\r\n&#x3C;span class=\"dollar\"> $&#x3C;/span>\r\n\r\n&#x3C;!-- This is still broken -->\r\n&#x3C;span class=\"dollar\">$ &#x3C;/span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>So we found that Javascript Engine in Safari parses the <code>>$&#x3C;</code> character incorrectly. It required atleast 3 characters within between the span.</p>\n<h1>Solution:</h1>\n<p>So to make the least breaking changes possible, I eneded up with the following.</p>\n<pre><code>&#x3C;!-- Safari fix: single dollar sign ($) breaks layout. -->\r\n&#x3C;span class=\"dollar\">&#x26;#36;&#x3C;/span>{{period_price}}\n</code></pre>\n<p>I would love to know why this breaks in Safari. But we'll have to investigate the root cause another day.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Strange Bug: Safari Parsing","date":"26 March, 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/programming/strangest-bugs/"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
