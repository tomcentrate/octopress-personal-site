## My apprehension

When I'm doing things by myself or at my job, I want to get it done. I've developed habits to avoid using new / exciting / untested stuff for production. I also avoid rolling my own...anything. For the client, and for anyone else down the line, maintenance can be more expensive and mentally tasking. They want a working awesome product.

Coming up with new projects, I don't imagine the minor (but important) details of my stack. I'm more interested in the end product. Architecting out a solution, drawing out my tables and relations, these are the parts I enjoy. My standard set of tools: Laravel / Rails, MySQL, Bootstrap, Nginx. Anything that gets it rolling out the door.
