So I'm sitting in a trampoline recreation center for my sister's party. Chaperoning and Chaffeuring around. With some downtime, and not in the physical fitness to jump around, it felt like a good time to pull out the laptop to work on some side projects.

At a few of these places, they offer guest networks as a common courtesy. Unfortunately, some of the free WI-FI connections aren't that great, and I could not get a solid connection. What's a guy to do?

In periods of network downtime, here are a few things I have done to feel slightly more productive.

### Program by Guessing.

How many times have you tried this? Picking up a new programming language, or framework, we let the IDE and it's QuickStart be our guide. Whenever I come from a language that's similar, I do a little divination, programming by guessing at what the method names or standard library names are. Sometimes we can get lucky.This time was not one of those times.

### Dissecting Examples
I'm pretty new to Android Development. For the short time I was without internet, I was thinking of doing something simple. I opened up a few template projects, and played with wiring up the different templates together. Android Studios' UI Builder was a definite good use of my time.


I'm sure a lot of you have done this before. I opened up an Android Project through Android Studio, and started relying on AutoCompletes. I did rely on hitting Firebase for my application, and without access to the network, I started a little service of my own. I'm pretty comfortable with Rails, so I created a small API Service and routed the firebase urls to my localhost. 

### Write Tests

There's probably not enough test coverage when we're building our personal projects.

While doing a little research, I came across [devdocs](http://devdocs.io/).
